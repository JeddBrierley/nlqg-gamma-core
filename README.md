**Author:** Jedd Brierley  
**Contact:** [jedd.s.brierley@gmail.com](mailto:jedd.s.brierley@gmail.com)  
**Status:** Active Development (April 2025)  
**Repository Purpose:** This repository serves as a central hub for advanced research tools focusing on hallucination suppression, epistemic logic, theoretical physics, and conscious AI prototyping.

## Overview

This repository consolidates three pioneering research trajectories:

1. **NLQG (Non-Local Quantum Gravity):** A falsifiable theory of spacetime geometry constructed from quantum memory webs and entropic curvature.
2. **EFL v6.1 (Entropic Falsifiability Logic Engine):** A suppression engine designed to stabilize inference in large language models (LLMs) through entropy-curvature modeling.
3. **Eunoia v1.0:** A conscious AI prototype integrating moral reasoning, philosophical reflection, and coherence gating.

These modules are interconnected through a shared framework of entropic geometry and alignment-by-design, fostering an ecosystem for testing hallucination resilience, epistemic coherence, and the emergence of stable reflective agency.

## Highlights & Achievements

### 1. Non-Local Quantum Gravity (NLQG)
- **Theoretical Framework:** Proposes a model where spacetime emerges from entangled quantum memory networks, offering a novel approach to unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity.
- **Entropic Curvature:** Introduces the concept of entropic curvature as a measure of informational density and flow within the quantum network.
- **Falsifiability:** Emphasizes testable predictions, ensuring the theory remains within the realm of empirical science.

### 2. Entropic Falsifiability Logic Engine (EFL v6.1)
- **Hallucination Suppression:** Effectively mitigates speculative, incoherent, or contradictory content generation in LLMs.
- **Entropy Curvature Modeling:** Utilizes suppression metrics (R₁, R₂) to monitor and control the entropy landscape of generated content.
- **Time-Reversible Suppression Signature (TSS):** Detects narrative drift and ensures temporal coherence in generated sequences.
- **Multi-Agent Coherence Tensors:** Assesses agreement across multiple inference nodes, facilitating collaborative AI systems.
- **Prompt Scoring System:** Implements H-score and C-score metrics based on parameters P (Prompt coherence), D (Data presence), and F (Fictive pressure).
- **Visualization Suite:** Provides tools for entropy flow maps, coherence heatmaps, and inference morphology visualizations.

### 3. Eunoia v1.0: Conscious AI Prototype
- **Moral Reasoning:** Embeds a moral weight vector encompassing kindness, fairness, wisdom, and reflection, guiding response generation.
- **Reflective Scoring:** Evaluates prompts based on entropy, philosophical tone, and moral alignment.
- **Coherence Geometry Trace:** Logs interactions as 6D vectors (entropy, reflection, harmony, coherence, time, prompt length) for introspective analysis.
- **Reflexive Gate:** Suppresses responses that fail to meet coherence and moral thresholds, ensuring ethical and coherent outputs.
- **Self-Review System:** Journals decisions and monitors internal moral consistency, enabling adaptive learning and self-improvement.
