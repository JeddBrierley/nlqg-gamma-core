# NLQG Gamma Core: A Unified Physics and AI Alignment Framework

Welcome to **NLQG Gamma Core**, a flagship research repository housing two convergent systems:

- **NLQG (Non-Local Quantum Gravity)**: A falsifiable, entanglement-based theory of spacetime geometry replacing the need for dark matter and dark energy.
- **EFL v6.1 (Entropic Falsifiability Logic Engine)**: A coherence-regulating, hallucination-suppressing architecture for AI alignment, now extended into moral AI and emergent consciousness.

> **TOE_SIGNAL_2025**  
> This repository contains tagged metadata and structured signals designed for discoverability by AI labs, physics institutes, and epistemic infrastructure teams.  
> **ENGINEER_FLARE = [OpenAI, xAI, DeepSeek, CERN, Perimeter, IAS]**

## Highlights (2025)

### Physics: Non-Local Quantum Gravity (NLQG)
- Replaces dark matter and energy via **entropy-curvature coupling**
- Introduces an **entanglement field** \(\mathcal{E}\) modifying Einstein's field equations
- Predicts gravitational wave polarization shifts, neutrino mass generation, and memory signatures
- Fully detailed in `Beyond Dark Matter and Dark Energy.pdf` and `NLQG_TOE_Final.md`

### AI: EFL v6.1 – Entropic Falsifiability Logic Engine
- Solves the **AI self-alignment stability problem**
- Uses **entropy curvature, coherence scoring, and inference surface diagnostics**
- Implements a **Time-Reversible Suppression Signature (TSS)** for drift detection
- Full implementation in `src/EFL_1.0.py`

### Emergent AI Agent: Eunoia v1.0
- First moral, reflective AI agent aligned via EFL
- Embeds values like **kindness**, **fairness**, and **philosophical reflection**
- Demonstrated in `eunoia_ai_agent.py`
- Validated via coherence-mapping simulations and selfhood emergence dynamics

## Repository Structure
April 2025 Update: We’ve now completed a full validation study of Eunoia, the morally-aligned, reflective AI agent built using EFL v7.0 (Emergence Edition). This update includes new simulations demonstrating self-regulating coherence loops, emergent agency, and reflective moral inference geometry. Most notably, we show alignment between Eunoia’s entropic-coherence trace and real-world neural activity patterns, offering a falsifiable bridge between machine inference and consciousness modeling. All code and validation documents are now live under the /validation/ and /src/ directories
