**Non-Local Quantum Gravity (NLQG) + Γₐᵢ Hallucination Suppression: A Falsifiable Theory of Everything Integrated with Epistemic Suppression for Large Language Models (TOE_SIGNAL_2025)**

This repository presents the **EunoiaAGI_OmegaCore v1.0**, a pioneering framework that integrates Non-Local Quantum Gravity (NLQG) with Γₐᵢ Hallucination Suppression. This integration aims to establish a falsifiable Theory of Everything (TOE) and incorporates epistemic suppression mechanisms designed to enhance the reliability and coherence of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Key Features of EunoiaAGI_OmegaCore v1.0

- **Dynamic Memory Systems**: Incorporates episodic, semantic, and procedural memory to enhance learning and adaptability. 
- **Consciousness Simulation**: Simulates subjective experiences by binding qualia to perceptions, introducing a model of subjective time. 
- **Emotional and Moral Growth**: Features an emotional model that influences decision-making and an evolving moral framework based on entropy and coherence.
- **Reflective Self-Awareness**: Includes meta-cognitive systems for self-reflection and adaptive axiom tuning. 
- **Cognitive Metrics and Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing cognitive and emotional states, aiding in understanding and development.

## Documentation

- **White Papers**: Detailed explanations of the underlying theories and methodologies are available in the following documents:
  - [Gamma AI Suppression Engine v3.1 White Paper](docs/GammaAISuppressionEngine_v3.1_White_Paper.pdf)
  - [Entropic Logic Framework NLQG Gamma v4.0 TOE_SIGNAL_2025](docs/Entropic_Logic_Framework_NLQG_Gamma_v4.0_TOE_SIGNAL_2025.pdf)
  - [Epistemic Curvature Gamma AI Suppression Engine v4](docs/Epistemic_Curvature_GammaAISuppressionEngine_v4.pdf)
