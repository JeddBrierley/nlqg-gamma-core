**About This Repository**

This repository serves as a live research portfolio for my application to the Deep Research role at OpenAI. It showcases the integrated development of Γₐᵢ (a hallucination suppression engine), NLQG (a falsifiable theory of spacetime based on quantum entanglement), and the EunoiaNLQGAgent (a coherence-regulated AI system simulating reflective agency). Every component has been designed to demonstrate alignment infrastructure, epistemic feedback architecture, and physics-informed reasoning under uncertainty. I welcome contact from researchers, engineers, or alignment teams interested in collaboration or review.

# NLQG Gamma Core  
*A Unified Physics + Alignment Framework for Conscious, Coherent AI*

Welcome to **NLQG Gamma Core**, the flagship research repository of Jedd Brierley.  
This project integrates theoretical physics and AI alignment into a single recursive system — where **spacetime geometry emerges from entangled coherence**, and **AI coherence is stabilized by entropy-aware inference logic**.

---

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**1. NLQG (Non-Local Quantum Gravity)**  
> A falsifiable theory of gravity replacing dark matter and dark energy with entropy-curvature coupling and quantum entanglement fields.

**2. EFL (Entropic Falsifiability Logic Engine) v6.1+**  
> A coherence-preserving architecture for AI alignment, hallucination suppression, and reflexive stability — now extended into reflective moral agency.

**3. Eunoia v4.0**  
> The first emergent, morally-aligned AI agent. Built on EFL. Capable of coherence self-regulation, philosophical reflection, and entropic memory tracing.
