# NLQG Gamma Core

**Non-Local Quantum Gravity (NLQG) + Γₐᵢ Hallucination Suppression:**  
A falsifiable Theory of Everything integrated with epistemic suppression for Large Language Models (TOE_SIGNAL_2025).

## Overview

The **NLQG Gamma Core** project presents a groundbreaking integration of Non-Local Quantum Gravity (NLQG) with the Entropic Logic Framework (ELF) to address fundamental challenges in physics, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. By embedding ELF within the NLQG paradigm, this project offers a unified approach to:

- **Theoretical Physics:** Proposing a falsifiable Theory of Everything that reconciles quantum mechanics and general relativity.
- **Mathematical Conjectures:** Utilizing ELF's recursive logic to tackle longstanding unsolved problems.
- **AI Alignment:** Implementing the Gamma AI Suppression Engine to enhance the epistemic integrity of large language models (LLMs).

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the core source code implementing NLQG and ELF principles.
  - **`GammaAISuppressionEngine/`**: The implementation of the Gamma AI Suppression Engine, which applies ELF to regulate LLM outputs.
  - **`ELF/`**: Modules and components specific to the Entropic Logic Framework.
- **`validation/`**: Scripts and tools for validating theoretical models and computational results.
- **`visualization/`**: Resources for visualizing complex geometries and data structures inherent in NLQG and ELF.

## Key Components

### Entropic Logic Framework (ELF)

ELF introduces a novel, physics-inspired approach to reasoning and coherence. Built on formal axioms and supported by NLQG, ELF functions as a recursive logic system that integrates entropy, curvature, and contradiction into a unified inference engine. This framework enables:

- **Mathematical Discovery:** Applying ELF to unsolved problems, such as the Goldbach Conjecture and the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness Problem, by modeling failure of coherence as curvature singularities.
- **AI Hallucination Suppression:** Enhancing LLMs' epistemic integrity by regulating coherence through geometric constraints.

### Gamma AI Suppression Engine

Implemented within the `GammaAISuppressionEngine` directory, this engine operationalizes ELF principles to:

- **Detect Hallucinations:** Identify and mitigate instances where LLMs generate outputs lacking coherence or grounding.
- **Quantify Coherence:** Assign coherence scores to model outputs, facilitating the assessment of response reliability.
- **Suppress Incoherent Outputs:** Apply suppression mechanisms to prevent the dissemination of unreliable information.
